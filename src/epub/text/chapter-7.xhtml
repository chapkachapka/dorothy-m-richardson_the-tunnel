Why must I always think of her in this place.... It
is always worst just along here.... Why do I
always forget there’s this piece ... always be hurrying
along seeing nothing and then suddenly Teetgen’s Teas
and this row of shops. I can’t bear it. I don’t know what
it is. It’s always the same. I always feel the same. It is
sending me mad. One day it will be worse. If it gets any
worse I shall be mad. Just here. Certainly. Something
is wearing out in me. I am meant to go mad. If not I
should not always be coming along this piece without
knowing it, whichever street I take. Other people would
know the streets apart. I don’t know where this bit is or
how I get to it. I come every day because I am meant
to go mad here. Something that knows brings me here
and is making me go mad because I am myself and nothing
changes me.
